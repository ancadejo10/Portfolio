                        Hi, my name is Arturo Del Callejo, and I'm a C++ programmer. 
                        I mainly use SDL2 and OpenGL, but I also focus on other areas. 
                        I currently have some basic projects that I've developed throughout my training as a programmer. 
                        I enjoy creating software and 3D graphics. 
                        I'm self-taught and am currently learning the Arduino Framework for ESP32 boards. 
                        I also have some experience developing games with Roblox Studio.
